### Development

Below are the steps I took to create the application as it is so far. The most difficult aspect of this application for me was using a constructor to cover all aspects of the notes (writing, reading, saving, deleting).

1. Created and seeded the initial MySQL files.

2. Downloaded all dependencies using npm.

3. Created the application using Node.js and tested.

4. Verify the functionality of the application.
